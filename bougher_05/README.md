# Restaurant Menu App

This is a simple restaurant menu app built using **React Native** and **TypeScript**. The app displays a main screen with restaurant details and allows users to navigate to a menu page that lists different food items. 

## Features

- **Home Screen**: Displays the restaurant's name, an image, contact information (phone number, website, address), and a button to navigate to the menu page.
- **Menu Screen**: Displays a list of menu items using a scrollable list, with each item showing its name, price, and an image.
- **Navigation**: Built with React Navigation to switch between the Home screen and Menu screen.
